## Issues faced

- Finiding the best icons to fit the design: this was kind of an extreme sport finding the icon that best suits the design but then i found a couple of that came in handy on this sites [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) and some other ones



## Feedback

I think its a really nice and interesting assesment, but then if there was a way in which we could be able to access an API with the book that way it would populate dynamically on the DOM either ways i enjoyed the process.
